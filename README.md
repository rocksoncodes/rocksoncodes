## About Me

I’m Michael Rockson, a junior backend-leaning software engineer focused on building practical APIs and backend systems that solve real problems and work reliably in real use.

I enjoy turning requirements into working features, building automation that reduces repetitive work and writing backend logic that’s clear, maintainable, and easy for others to build on.

## How I Use This GitHub

This GitHub is a collection of backend-focused projects and small systems built to solve specific problems.

The pinned repositories represent my best work and how I approach:
- API design
- Backend logic
- Data modeling
- Reliability and maintainability

The projects may be small, but each one is built with real-world use in mind.
